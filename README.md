# Low-Cost-Calorimetry-Plateform
This repository introduces the low-cost calorimetry platform I have developed at the University of Minho (Portugal) in the framework of my PhD thesis. This platform allows to conduct isothermal and adiabatic calorimetry with lab-grade accuracy, as well as DSC applications. The extensive validation process can be found in my thesis.
